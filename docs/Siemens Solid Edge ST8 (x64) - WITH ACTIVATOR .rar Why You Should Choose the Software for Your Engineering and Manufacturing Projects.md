Some of the features of Solid Edge ST8 are:

- Synchronous technology: This is a unique approach that allows you to edit geometry directly without worrying about the history or constraints. You can also use synchronous technology to work with imported data from other CAD systems, or to combine parametric and direct modeling in the same environment.
- Pattern recognition and editing: Solid Edge ST8 can automatically recognize and edit patterns of features, such as holes, slots, ribs, or teeth. You can also create patterns by using a table of values to define the position and orientation of each instance.
- Data exchange: Solid Edge ST8 supports a variety of file formats for importing and exporting data, such as STEP, IGES, DXF, DWG, PDF, JT, and more. You can also share your data with the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry using the IFC format.

Siemens Solid Edge ST8 also provides you with tools for simulation and manufacturing. You can use Solid Edge to validate your designs, optimize them for performance, and prepare them for production.
 
Some of the simulation and manufacturing features of Solid Edge ST8 are:

- Simulation analysis: Solid Edge ST8 allows you to perform finite element analysis (FEA) on your models, using proven Femap and Simcenter Nastran technology. You can apply loads and constraints, define material properties, and run linear static, modal, buckling, or heat transfer analyses. You can also view and interpret the results using color-coded contour plots, animations, graphs, and reports.
- Simulation on convergent models: Solid Edge ST8 enables you to perform simulation on models that are created or imported using convergent modeling technology. This means you can work with complex shapes, such as scanned data or mesh models, without having to convert them to traditional B-rep geometry. You can also use synchronous technology to edit the convergent models directly.
- Manufacturing: Solid Edge ST8 supports various manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing, sheet metal fabrication, machining, welding, and assembly. You can create 2D drawings and 3D annotations from your 3D models, generate flat patterns and bend tables for sheet metal parts, create toolpaths and NC code for CNC machines, and document your assembly procedures and bills of materials.

With Solid Edge ST8, you can take your designs from concept to reality with confidence and efficiency.
