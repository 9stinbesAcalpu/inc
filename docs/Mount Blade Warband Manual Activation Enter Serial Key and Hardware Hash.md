A serial key is a unique code that you receive when you purchase the game from an authorized retailer or online platform. It proves that you own a legitimate copy of the game and allows you to access its features.
 
There are two ways to activate Mount & Blade: Warband with a serial key: online activation and manual activation. In this article, we will explain both methods and help you troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
