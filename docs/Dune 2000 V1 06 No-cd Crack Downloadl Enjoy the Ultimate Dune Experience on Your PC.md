However, one of the drawbacks of playing Dune 2000 on PC is that it requires the original CD to run. This can be inconvenient if you have lost or damaged your CD, or if you want to play the game on a laptop without a CD drive. Fortunately, there is a way to play Dune 2000 without a CD, using a no-CD patch.
 
A no-CD patch is a small file that modifies the game's executable file to bypass the CD check. This allows you to run the game without inserting the CD every time. There are several no-CD patches available for Dune 2000, but the most reliable one is the v1.06 US patch by XHell. This patch works with the latest official update of the game and also fixes some bugs and compatibility issues.
 
To use this no-CD patch, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the official Dune 2000 v1.06 US update from Westwood Studios' website and install it over your existing game installation.
2. Download the Dune 2000 v1.06 US no-CD patch by XHell from MegaGames.com and unzip it to your game folder.
3. Run the Dune2K106Crk.exe file and follow the instructions to apply the patch.
