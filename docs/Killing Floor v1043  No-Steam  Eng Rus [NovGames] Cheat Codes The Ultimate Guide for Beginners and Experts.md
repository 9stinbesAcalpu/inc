### Killing Floor v1043 | No-Steam | Eng Rus [NovGames] Cheat Codes: How to Improve Your Gameplay Skills
 
While cheat codes can be fun and useful, they are not a substitute for skill and strategy. If you want to improve your gameplay skills in Killing Floor v1043 | No-Steam | Eng Rus [NovGames], you will need to practice and learn some tips and tricks. Here are some of them:

- Avoid being trapped in a corner. The enemies in Killing Floor come in waves from various directions. Some of the enemies can be taken out with a couple of shots or melee attacks, but the stronger monsters require you to shoot while running away[^1^]. If you get cornered by a horde of zeds, you will have a hard time escaping and surviving. Try to keep moving and use the environment to your advantage.
- Use your pistol ammo on weak enemies. The pistol is your default weapon that has unlimited ammo. It is not very powerful, but it can be effective against weak enemies like clots and crawlers[^1^]. Use your pistol ammo on them and save your better weapons for stronger enemies like scrakes and fleshpounds[^2^]. And remember that when playing on consoles, you can tap the weapon select button to switch between your pistol and your last used weapon quickly[^2^].
- Decapitate enemies whenever possible. Most zeds can be killed quickly with decapitation[^1^]. You can use melee weapons like machete or axe for cheap kills[^1^], or aim for the head with firearms. Decapitating enemies also prevents them from screaming or exploding[^1^], which can cause damage or panic to you and your teammates.
- Listen for audio cues. The zeds in Killing Floor make distinctive sounds that can alert you of their presence and type[^1^ 8cf37b1e13
