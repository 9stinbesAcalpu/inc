One of the most distinctive features of Grigori Grabovoi's teachings is the use of numerical sequences to heal and harmonize various aspects of life. According to Grabovoi, every number has a specific vibration and meaning, and by combining them in certain ways, one can create a code that corresponds to a desired state or goal. For example, the numerical sequence 1489999 represents the norm of laboratory parameters, which can be used to restore one's health and balance.
 
To use numerical sequences effectively, one needs to concentrate on them with a clear intention and focus. There are different methods of concentration that Grabovoi suggests, such as writing them down, visualizing them, saying them aloud, or using devices that generate them. The main point is to connect with the Creative Field of Information and align one's consciousness with the desired result. By doing so, one can activate the self-healing and self-regulating mechanisms of the body and mind, and also influence the external reality in a positive way.
 
Numerical sequences are not the only tools that Grabovoi offers to his students. He also teaches how to use geometric shapes, colors, sounds, words, and other elements of perception to create and control information. He explains how to use one's soul, spirit, and consciousness to access higher dimensions of existence and communicate with the Creator. He reveals how to resurrect oneself and others from physical death and attain eternal life. He demonstrates how to prevent and eliminate any possible global catastrophe and ensure the harmonious development of all civilizations.
 
Grigori Grabovoi's teachings are not based on any dogma or religion, but on scientific knowledge and universal laws. He invites everyone to verify his methods and results by personal experience and observation. He encourages everyone to share his teachings with others and spread the message of salvation and harmonious development. He believes that everyone has the potential to become a creator of their own reality and a co-creator of the common reality with God.
