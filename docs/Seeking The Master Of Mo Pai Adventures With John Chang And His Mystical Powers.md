Mo Pai is a secretive and controversial art that claims to teach its practitioners how to harness and manipulate the life force energy, or chi, that flows through all living things. By cultivating and storing chi in their bodies, Mo Pai adepts can allegedly perform extraordinary feats, such as healing, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, and even levitation.
 
Mo Pai is said to have originated from an ancient lineage of Taoist masters who passed down their knowledge and skills through oral transmission and initiation. The current head of this lineage is John Chang, a Chinese-Indonesian healer and martial artist who lives in Jakarta. John Chang rose to fame in the 1980s when he was featured in a documentary called Ring of Fire, where he demonstrated his abilities to the filmmakers. He also appeared in a book by Kosta Danaos called The Magus of Java, where he revealed more details about his life and teachings.
 
However, John Chang is also a very secretive and selective master who does not accept many students and does not want his art to be publicized or commercialized. He has imposed strict rules and conditions on his disciples, such as celibacy, secrecy, loyalty, and obedience. He has also warned them of the dangers and responsibilities of Mo Pai, such as the risk of injury, illness, or death from improper practice, or the karmic consequences of using Mo Pai for selfish or harmful purposes.

One of the most fascinating and controversial aspects of Mo Pai is the demonstration of its effects on the physical world. John Chang has been filmed and witnessed by many people performing incredible feats of energy manipulation, such as burning paper, moving objects, healing wounds, and shocking people with electric currents. He claims that these are not tricks or illusions, but natural results of his mastery of chi.
 
However, not everyone is convinced or impressed by John Chang's abilities. Some skeptics have dismissed his demonstrations as hoaxes or frauds, while others have accused him of violating the laws of nature and ethics. Some critics have also questioned his motives and intentions, wondering why he would reveal his secrets to the public and expose himself to danger and scrutiny.
 
John Chang himself has expressed mixed feelings about his fame and reputation. He has stated that he does not seek attention or recognition, but rather wants to share his knowledge and wisdom with those who are sincere and worthy. He has also expressed frustration and disappointment with some of his students and followers, who have either betrayed him, disobeyed him, or failed to progress in their practice. He has also hinted that he may retire or disappear from the public eye soon, leaving behind a legacy of mystery and wonder.
