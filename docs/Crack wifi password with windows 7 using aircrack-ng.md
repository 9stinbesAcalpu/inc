# How to Crack Wi-Fi Password with Windows 7
 
Wi-Fi passwords are designed to protect wireless networks from unauthorized access. However, sometimes you may need to crack a Wi-Fi password for legitimate reasons, such as connecting to your own network when you forgot the password or testing the security of your network. In this article, we will show you how to crack a Wi-Fi password with Windows 7 using some popular tools and techniques.

Before we begin, we need to clarify some terms and concepts related to Wi-Fi security. Wi-Fi networks use different security protocols to encrypt the data transmitted over them. The most common ones are WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), WPA2 and WPA3. WEP is the oldest and weakest protocol, and it can be easily cracked within minutes. WPA and WPA2 are more secure, but they can also be vulnerable to brute force attacks or dictionary attacks, which try different combinations of passwords or words until they find the right one. WPA3 is the newest and most secure protocol, but it is not widely adopted yet.
 
To crack a Wi-Fi password, you need to capture the data packets that are exchanged between the network and the devices connected to it. These packets contain information that can help you recover the password, such as the network name (SSID), the encryption type and the handshake (a four-way exchange of cryptographic keys). To capture these packets, you need a wireless adapter that supports monitor mode, which allows it to capture all the traffic on a channel without being associated with a network. You also need a tool that can analyze the captured packets and crack the password.
 
## Aircrack-ng
 
One of the most popular tools for Wi-Fi password cracking is Aircrack-ng. Aircrack-ng is a suite of tools that can capture, analyze and crack Wi-Fi passwords. It works with any wireless network interface controller whose driver supports raw monitoring mode and can sniff 802.11a/b/g/n traffic. Aircrack-ng supports WEP, WPA and WPA2 security protocols.
 
To use Aircrack-ng, you need to download it from [https://www.aircrack-ng.org/](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) and install it on your Windows 7 computer. You also need to download and install WinPcap, a packet capture library that Aircrack-ng uses to access the wireless adapter. You can download WinPcap from [https://www.winpcap.org/](https://www.winpcap.org/).
 
Once you have installed Aircrack-ng and WinPcap, you can follow these steps to crack a Wi-Fi password:
 
1. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges. You can do this by clicking on the Start menu, typing "cmd" (without quotes) in the search box, right-clicking on the cmd.exe program and selecting "Run as administrator".
2. Type "airmon-ng" (without quotes) in the command prompt and press Enter. This will list all the wireless adapters on your computer and their status. Note down the name of your wireless adapter (e.g., wlan0).
3. Type "airmon-ng start wlan0" (without quotes) in the command prompt and press Enter. This will put your wireless adapter in monitor mode and create a new interface called wlan0mon.
4. Type "airodump-ng wlan0mon" (without quotes) in the command prompt and press Enter. This will start scanning for all the wireless networks in range and display their information, such as SSID, BSSID (MAC address), channel, encryption type and signal strength. Note down the BSSID and channel of the network you want to crack.
5. Type "Ctrl+C" to stop scanning and open a new command prompt with administrative privileges.
6. Type "airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w [filename] wlan0mon" (without quotes) in the new command prompt and press Enter. Replace [channel] with the channel number of the network you want to crack, [BSSID] with its MAC address and [filename] with any name you want for the output file. This will start capturing packets from the target network and save them in a file with .cap extension.
