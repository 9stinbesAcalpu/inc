In this article, we will show you how to uninstall ENB Skyrim Special Edition in a few easy steps. We will also provide some tips on how to backup your game files and avoid common errors. Let's get started!
 
## Step 1: Disable the ENB Mod
 
The first thing you need to do is to disable the ENB mod from your game. To do this, you need to open the in-game ENB menu by pressing Shift+Enter on your keyboard. This will bring up a window with various settings and options for the mod. You need to look for the option that says "UseEffect" and uncheck it. This will turn off the ENB effects from your game.
 
Alternatively, you can also disable the ENB mod by editing the enblocal.ini file in your Skyrim Special Edition folder. This is a configuration file that controls some aspects of the mod. You need to open it with a text editor such as Notepad and look for the line that says "UseEffect=true". You need to change it to "UseEffect=false" and save the file.
 
Either way, disabling the ENB mod will prevent it from loading when you launch your game. However, this is not enough to completely uninstall it. You still need to delete some files from your game folder.
 
## Step 2: Delete the ENB Files
 
The next step is to delete the ENB files from your Skyrim Special Edition folder. These are the files that contain the actual code and data for the mod. They are usually located in the same folder as your SkyrimSE.exe file, which is typically in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition.

You can simply select these files and press Delete on your keyboard, or right-click and choose Delete from the menu. You may need to confirm that you want to permanently delete these files.
 
Some ENB presets may also include additional files or folders that you need to delete. These may vary depending on the preset you have installed, but they usually have names that start with "enb" or contain the name of the preset. For example, if you have installed Rudy ENB, you may also need to delete these files:

- Rudy HQ - More Lights.esp
- Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB SE.esp
- Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB SE - Bthardamz.esp
- Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB SE - Dragonborn.esp

- Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB SE - Soul Cairn.esp
- Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB SE - Volkihar Castle.esp
- RudyENBSE.ini
- RudyENBSE folder

You can check the readme file or the installation instructions of your ENB preset to see if there are any other files or folders that you need to delete.
