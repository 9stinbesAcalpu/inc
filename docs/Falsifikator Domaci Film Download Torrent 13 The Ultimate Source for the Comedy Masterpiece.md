# Falsifikator: A Comedy-Drama Film About a Yugoslav Forger
 
Falsifikator is a 2013 Serbian film directed by Goran Markovi√Ñ¬á and starring Tihomir Stani√Ñ¬á, Branka Kati√Ñ¬á, Dragan Petrovi√Ñ¬á, and Sergej Trifunovi√Ñ¬á. The film is based on the true story of An√Ñ¬ëelko Kralj, a forger who created fake diplomas, passports, and other documents for people in Yugoslavia during the communist era.
 
The film follows An√Ñ¬ëelko's life from 1968 to 1991, as he witnesses the rise and fall of Yugoslavia and its leader Josip Broz Tito, whom he admires and imitates. An√Ñ¬ëelko is a naive and idealistic man who believes in the socialist system and tries to help his fellow citizens with his forgery skills. However, he also gets into trouble with the authorities, his family, and his clients, who often have ulterior motives for using his services.
