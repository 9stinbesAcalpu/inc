Navnath Bhaktisar Adhyay 40 is the most important chapter in the book of Navnath Pothi, a sacred text of the Nath sect of Hinduism. It contains the essence of the whole Navnath Bhaktisar, which is a collection of stories and teachings of the nine Naths, who are considered to be the incarnations of Lord Shiva. Reading this chapter is like reading the whole book, as it summarizes the main themes and messages of the Naths.
 
The chapter narrates how Charpatinath, one of the nine Naths, defeated Indra, the king of gods, and other deities with his miraculous powers and yogic skills. He also visited various realms of existence, such as heaven, hell, earth and netherworld, and performed various feats that astonished everyone. He then returned to his own place and resumed his meditation.

The chapter also describes how Indra and other gods were amazed by Charpatinath's prowess and wanted to bring him to their abode and honor him. They consulted Brihaspati, the guru of gods, who suggested that they should perform a yajna (sacrifice) and invite Charpatinath as a guest. He also advised them to use their charm and devotion to win his favor and persuade him to stay with them.
 
The chapter ends with Indra sending Kachata, one of his attendants, to invite Charpatinath to the yajna. Kachata praises Charpatinath as the supreme Nath and the son of Machhindranath, who is revered as the first Nath. He also mentions that Charpatinath is known as Uparichar, meaning one who moves in the upper regions.
