#### How to Choose a Dragon Ball Movie to Watch
 
With so many Dragon Ball movies available, you might be wondering which one to watch first. There is no definitive answer to this question, as different movies appeal to different tastes and preferences. However, here are some general tips to help you choose a Dragon Ball movie to watch:
 
- If you want to watch the movies in chronological order, you can follow this list[^2^] that shows the timeline of the movies in relation to the anime series. However, keep in mind that some movies contradict or ignore the events of the series, so they are not always consistent.
- If you want to watch the movies that are considered canon, meaning they follow the original manga plot and are approved by Akira Toriyama, you can watch Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (2013), Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' (2015) and Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018). These movies are also adapted into arcs of the Dragon Ball Super anime series.
- If you want to watch the movies that are fan favorites, you can check out some of the most popular and acclaimed movies among the fans, such as Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan (1993), Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn (1995), Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon (1995) and Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018). These movies feature some of the most iconic and powerful villains and transformations in the franchise.
- If you want to watch the movies that are original and creative, you can try some of the movies that have unique stories and concepts that are not seen in the series, such as Dragon Ball: Mystical Adventure (1988), Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug (1991), Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge (1991) and Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler (1992). These movies introduce new worlds and characters that expand the Dragon Ball universe.

- If you want to download or stream Dragon Ball movies with Serbian subtitles or dubbing, you can use some of the websites that provide them for free or for a fee.
