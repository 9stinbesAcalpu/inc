# How to Learn WinDev, WebDev and WinDev Mobile in 12 Steps
 
WinDev, WebDev and WinDev Mobile are powerful integrated development environments that allow you to create applications for Windows, Web and Mobile platforms. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn how to use these tools in 12 easy steps.
 
1. Download and install WinDev, WebDev and WinDev Mobile from [the official website](https://windev.com/windevmobile/index.html). You can try them for free for 30 days.
2. Explore the online help and documentation for each tool. You can access them from [this link](https://help.windev.com/). You will find concepts, tutorials, examples, videos and tips.
3. Create your first project and analysis. A project is a set of elements (windows, pages, reports, queries, etc.) that make up an application. An analysis is a description of the database structure and the business rules of your application.
4. Design your user interface using windows and controls. Windows are the main elements of a desktop or mobile application. Controls are the components that allow you to interact with the user (buttons, edits, tables, etc.). You can use layouts to adapt your interface to different screen sizes and orientations.
5. Write your business logic using WLanguage. WLanguage is a simple and powerful programming language that allows you to manipulate data, perform calculations, handle events, call external functions and more. You can use the code editor and the debugger to write and test your code.
6. Connect your application to a database using queries and data sources. Queries are SQL statements that allow you to retrieve or modify data from a database. Data sources are links between controls and data files or queries. You can use HFSQL, the native database engine of WinDev, WebDev and WinDev Mobile, or other database systems (Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, etc.).
7. Create reports to display or print data from your application. Reports are documents that allow you to present data in a formatted way (tables, charts, labels, etc.). You can use the report editor to design your reports and the report viewer to preview them.
8. Use smart controls to add advanced features to your application. Smart controls are ready-to-use controls that provide specific functionalities (maps, calendars, kanban boards, etc.). You can customize their appearance and behavior using properties and methods.
9. Add menus to your application to organize its functionality. Menus are elements that allow you to group commands or options for the user. You can use the menu editor to create your menus and submenus.
10. Test your application on different platforms and devices. You can use the simulator or the emulator to test your application on a virtual device. You can also use the remote debugger to test your application on a real device connected to your computer.
11. Generate and deploy your application. Generation is the process of creating an executable file from your project. Deployment is the process of installing your application on a target platform or device. You can use different generation modes (debug mode, executable mode) and setup types (automatic setup, manual setup).
12. Use the project dashboard and the source code manager to manage your project. The project dashboard is a tool that allows you to monitor the progress of your project (requirements, tasks, business rules). The source code manager is a tool that allows you to manage the versions of your project elements and collaborate with other developers.

By following these 12 steps, you will be able to create powerful applications for Windows, Web and Mobile platforms using WinDev, WebDev and WinDev Mobile.
