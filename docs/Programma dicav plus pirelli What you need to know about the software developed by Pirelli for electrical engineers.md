Programma dicav plus pirelli is a software developed by Pirelli, a leading manufacturer of cables and systems for energy and telecommunications. It is designed to help electrical engineers calculate the optimal size and type of cables for different applications, according to the standards and regulations in force.
 
The software allows users to input various parameters, such as voltage, current, power factor, load factor, ambient temperature, installation method, cable length, and number of conductors. Based on these inputs, the software calculates the voltage drop, the short-circuit current, the thermal resistance, and the maximum permissible current for each cable section. It also provides a graphical representation of the cable layout and a detailed report of the results.

Programma dicav plus pirelli is a user-friendly and reliable tool that can save time and money for electrical engineers. It can help them design safe and efficient electrical installations, avoiding over-sizing or under-sizing of cables, which can cause problems such as overheating, fire hazards, energy losses, or poor performance.
 
The software is compatible with Windows operating systems and can be downloaded from various online sources[^1^] [^2^]. However, some users have reported difficulties in running the software on newer versions of Windows[^1^]. In that case, they may need to use an emulator or a virtual machine to run the software.
 
If you are looking for a professional and easy-to-use software for cable sizing and selection, you may want to try Programma dicav plus pirelli. It is a valuable tool for electrical engineers who work with Pirelli cables and systems.
  
Programma dicav plus pirelli is not the only software that Pirelli offers for electrical engineers. Pirelli also has other software products, such as JDC and PDC, that can help with the design and installation of electrical systems.
 
JDC is a software that allows users to calculate the optimal jointing and termination solutions for medium and high voltage cables. It can also generate technical drawings and specifications for the joints and terminations. JDC is based on the international standards and the Pirelli catalogue of accessories.
 
PDC is a software that allows users to design and simulate the performance of power distribution networks. It can also provide recommendations for the optimal configuration and operation of the network. PDC is based on the load flow and short-circuit analysis methods.
 
Both JDC and PDC are available for download from the Pirelli website or from other online sources. They are compatible with Windows operating systems and require a registration code to activate them.
