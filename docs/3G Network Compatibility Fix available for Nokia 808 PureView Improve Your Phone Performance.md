Nokia has released a new firmware update for its 41-megapixel camera phone, the Nokia 808 PureView. The update, version 2.30, is a ROM update that fixes a 3G bug that some users reported after installing the Belle FP2 update.
 
The 3G bug caused the device to reboot multiple times when using 3G data or voice services. According to Nokia, the fix prepares the device for possible network updates, without which voice and data services may stop working properly.

But the 808 PureView is not just about high-resolution stills. It also offers a unique feature called PureView mode, which uses pixel oversampling to create lower-resolution images with higher quality and lower noise. In PureView mode, the user can choose between 3MP, 5MP or 8MP output sizes, and also benefit from a 'lossless zoom' feature that allows up to 3X zoom (in 3MP mode) without any loss of detail or quality.
 
PureView mode also works in video recording, where the 808 PureView can capture 1080p HD video at up to 25Mb/s with up to 4X lossless zoom. The video quality is enhanced by Nokia's Rich Recording technology, which uses two microphones to record stereo sound at up to 140db. The 808 PureView also supports HDMI output, so you can watch your videos on a larger screen.
