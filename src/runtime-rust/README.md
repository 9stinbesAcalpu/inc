# runtime-rust

A rewrite `startup.c` in Rust, as an exercise in learning Rust.
Pointless? The rewrite does nothing better than in the original.

All the tests pass.

In Scheme, from `..`:
```
(load "compiler.scm")
(load "runtime-rust/tests-driver-modif.scm")`
(test-al)```

See `runtime-rust/tests-driver-modif.scm` for how to build and run.
